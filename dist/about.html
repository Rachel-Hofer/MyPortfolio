                <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
                <p class="bio-para">I received a BS Degree in Management from Loyola University
                    Chicago and have 7+ years of Sales & Revenue Management experience in the Hospitality Industry.<br><br>

                    Over the last few years, under the guidance of incredible mentors and hospitality leaders, I have
                    grown both professionally and personally in ways I could not have imagined. It was this confidence
                    and success I achieved during this time that has allowed me the opportunity to leave my comfort
                    zone and pursue a recently discovered dream that I feel very passionately about - Web Development.<br><br>

                    In December of 2018, I graduated Ironhackâ€™s full-time Web Development bootcamp in Miami, FL. I am
                    excited to combine my love for math and problem-solving with creative and innovative thinking. I
                    look forward to being a part of this ever-evolving industry and hope to contribute toward its
                    continuous growth.</p>
